title: Fixing CVE-2021-28834
date: 2021-04-03 01:10:00 -0530
categories: vulnerability, security

Slowly getting used to Github.io ecosystem. Their dependabot alerts are pretty cool. There has been a security issue with the *kramdown* gem used in my Jekyll installation. The bot alerted and instructed me about fixing the issue. Took just few minutes to update the packages and the *Gemfile*. All should be well now.
